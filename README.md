## Overview
The website is to demonstrate a couple of things:
  * To establish practice and execution of HTML and CSS skills.
  * To make available my credentials to potential employers.



## Specifics

  * Fonts are kept basic for translating over multiple devices and browsers.
  * Color theme is minimal, as to practice the fundamentals.
  * The arrangement was mirrored according to a homework assignment in order to practice interpreting a design and replicating it.
  * Work section designed in a way to quickly communicate what the projects were and a brief visual to accompany it.
  * With Flex being used, screen resizing is responsive. There are some basic adjustments made, but more to come as more work is done over the course of the program.
